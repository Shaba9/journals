The motivation behind my learning is mostly fueled by my curiosity of the world, how it works, and its purpose. I find the gift of intelligence truly fascinating, and it feels as though that the least I can do to honor it is to strive for attaining the highest levels of learning possible, combined with using it to contribute to the progress of an ever evolving civilization.

Today was a day of a lot of learning. Encountering the localStorage for the first time definitely proved its challenges. It took a while to play around with and understand how it works before implementing it into the lab. As a result, however, I have a working and a semi in-depth understanding of how localStorage and its methods work. I could not quite complete the lab, but certainly learned A LOT of new things.

The motivations behind learning, for me, are neither strictly intrinsic nor extrinsic. I mostly do it out of a curiosity to explore the limits of human intelligence, and to use it to help society reach more advanced levels of functioning.

The most unexpected part of today's lab was thinking it was complete, but realizing the local storage was not working right. A couple of hours and two TA's later, we still didn't figure it out. When I got home, however, I cleaned up the code, tried some different things in a much simpler environment, and it made the problem-solving process so much easier. I eventually figured it out not too long afterwards since the TA's helped rule out a lot of possible issues during my time with them. The insight from all this, I guess, is that sometimes taking some time away from the code, simplifying your process to smaller steps, and asking other minds to join in on the problem-solving really helps.

I definitely find learning through action to be more effective than spectating; especially through teaching others, putting into practice what was learned, and engaging in group discussions. I, nonetheless, view the learning process more cyclic in nature since all components are needed for a more wholistic and in-depth learning to take place.
