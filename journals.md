The motivation behind my learning is mostly fueled by my curiosity of the world, how it works, and its purpose. I find the gift of intelligence truly fascinating, and it feels as though that the least I can do to honor it is to strive for attaining the highest levels of learning possible, combined with using it to contribute to the progress of an ever evolving civilization.

Today was a day of a lot of learning. Encountering the localStorage for the first time definitely proved its challenges. It took a while to play around with and understand how it works before implementing it into the lab. As a result, however, I have a working and a semi in-depth understanding of how localStorage and its methods work. I could not quite complete the lab, but certainly learned A LOT of new things.

The motivations behind learning, for me, are neither strictly intrinsic nor extrinsic. I mostly do it out of a curiosity to explore the limits of human intelligence, and to use it to help society reach more advanced levels of functioning.

The most unexpected part of today's lab was thinking it was complete, but realizing the local storage was not working right. A couple of hours and two TA's later, we still didn't figure it out. When I got home, however, I cleaned up the code, tried some different things in a much simpler environment, and it made the problem-solving process so much easier. I eventually figured it out not too long afterwards since the TA's helped rule out a lot of possible issues during my time with them. The insight from all this, I guess, is that sometimes taking some time away from the code, simplifying your process to smaller steps, and asking other minds to join in on the problem-solving really helps.

I definitely find learning through action to be more effective than spectating; especially through teaching others, putting into practice what was learned, and engaging in group discussions. I, nonetheless, view the learning process more cyclic in nature since all components are needed for a more wholistic and in-depth learning to take place.

There was definitely a time when Imposter Syndrome was clouding my judgment and interfering with growth. After a couple of decades in this world, however, I have observed that this syndrome takes place only when you begin to compare yourself to others and that, honestly, no one knows what they are doing; and if they say they do they are lying. This is due to the fact that learning is an ever evolving process; you cannot possibly know it all because it is always changing.

Another good tactic for guarding against Imposter Syndrome is remembering that everyone has something to contribute; that the world does not revolve around you and you are indeed contributing to a larger whole. In other words, maintaining a higher sense of purpose in your work frees you from the anxieties over trivial matters, and keeps you focused on developing values that last long-term. Lastly, there will be, no matter how much our highly independent culture proclaims,parts of your destiny that you cannot possibly control. Putting in your best effort but also remaining detached from the outcome makes the learning journey much more effective and enjoyable.

Today I learned more about classes, constructor methods, and render methods as they apply to module-type components. It was quite difficult to, at first, understand its implementation into the Pokemon app since the code was already simplified and following the component architecture. However, once I figured out the best way to structure it, the re-organizing of the code so that it is further separated into template functions and render methods went smoothly.

The strategy I use to learn from disappointments is that I do not expect much to begin with. That is, I try to remain detached from what I want, and focus more on the learning experience in the moment. Though, it is no easy task.

Something that was easier to learn than I expected was the <canvas> element. When going through the readings, at first, it looked more complicated than it really was. Then I got to try it out, and it turned out to not be so bad. All the more complex things, such as the component architecture, just takes a lot of time to get used to, but I also expected it would. Not sure if that counts...

Today I learned that GitHub is sensitive to directory paths. I tried dot-slash; dot-dot-slash; no dots just slash; and no dots and no slash. Finally, no dots and no slash was the acceptable one, but only if the file is in the same directory. Who knows how it takes the others!
