        The pair programming concept was an interesting experience. It almost seemed like the system would work better between more experienced developers. That is, if the "navigator" had the terminology in mind and if the "driver" were familiar with the syntax, thoughts would be communicated more smoothly and executed more fluently.<br><br>

        Additionally, although we maintained the requirements of switching every 25 minutes and the "navigator" not touching the code at any time, the working environment took a more collaborative turn. In other words, we were utilizing each other's strengths as well as developing new ones.
